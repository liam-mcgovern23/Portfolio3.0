It starts with labeled observations, which are divided into a training set and a test set. The training set is used by a machine learning algorithm to create a prediction model. This model is then tested using the test set to evaluate its performance, with the results summarised in a statistical report. The process involves iterative improvement of the model based on its accuracy and the stats provided. .</li>

In supervised learning, each data point in the training set is labeled with the correct answer, and the model learns to predict these labels by determining a decision boundary. Once trained, it can apply this knowledge to new, unseen data. Unsupervised learning, in contrast, deals with unlabeled data. The model looks for patterns and structures within the data, such as clustering similar data points together. The resulting model can then assign new data points to these discovered clusters without prior knowledge of any labels.</li>

                                                            <p>In his blog post "Two Types of Startup Data Problems," Yanir Seroussi delineates the distinctive categories of data challenges encountered by startups, dividing them into two distinct types: those necessitating machine learning operations (MLOps) and those that do not. For startups heavily reliant on machine learning, where ML forms the backbone of their products, the emphasis is on adeptly managing the entire lifecycle of ML models, encompassing efficient training, deployment, and ongoing maintenance. Conversely, non-ML startups may defer extensive data operations until they attain product-market fit, initially prioritizing minimal viable data practices. By recognizing and categorizing these distinct data challenges, startups can tailor their strategies and resource allocation accordingly, ultimately optimizing their chances of success in the competitive startup landscape.</p>

                        <h1>More About Me</h1>
                        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                        <h3>I enjoy a variety of activities during my free time that keep me active, relaxed, and connected with friends. Playing for St. Vincent's GAA Club is a big part of my life. The games are exciting and the practices challenging, but more than that, they help me build strong friendships and learn important skills like working together and staying positive, whether we win or lose. <br>
                           <br>
                            <ul class="actions">
                            <li><a href="https://stvincentsgaa.ie/" class="button scrolly">My Club website </a></li>
                        </ul>

                            Swimming in the sea at places like High Rock in Malahide or Dollymount is another hobby I love. It's calming and invigorating to swim in the open water, and I feel refreshed and more connected to the natural world around me with every swim.
                            <br>
                            <ul class="actions">

                        </ul>
                            I also go to Westwood Gym in Clontarf regularly. It's not just about working out; I really enjoy using the spa area to relax and help my muscles recover after exercise. This keeps me ready for my next workout or game day.
                            <br>
                            <ul class="actions">

                        </ul>
                            Golf is another sport I take part in at Clontarf Golf Club. Playing golf teaches me patience and helps improve my focus as I try to make the perfect shot. It's also incredibly peaceful to play in the early morning when it's just me, the course, and the quiet.
                            <br>
                            <ul class="actions">

                        </ul>
                            
                            Socialising is an important part of my life too. Whether I'm catching up with friends over coffee in the morning or hanging out at local pubs, I cherish these times. These moments are fun and they strengthen the friendships that are important to me.
                            
                            All these activities are more than just hobbies. They keep me healthy, bring me happiness, and make my life fuller. Each one has its own special place in my week, helping me grow as a person and enjoy life to the fullest.<h3>
