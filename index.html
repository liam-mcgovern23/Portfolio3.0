                        <h2>About Me</h2>
                        <p>I am a dedicated and driven student specializing in Data Analytics, currently pursuing a Bachelor of Business Studies with a concentration on various different platforms, tools and skills at Dublin City University. My academic journey has been complemented by hands-on experience in various analytical roles, including a pivotal position as a Fraud Analyst. I honed my skills in data manipulation and analysis using advanced tools such as Python, SQL, and Power BI throughout various modules in college such as Professional Business Analytics Portfolio, Data Mining & Predictive Analytics and Workflow and Data Management. My career ambition is to harness my analytical acumen and technical prowess to significantly influence business strategies and operational efficiency in a leading-edge corporate setting.

                            With a strong commitment to professional growth and a passion for leveraging data to solve complex business challenges, I aim to continuously expand my skill set and knowledge base through ongoing education and real-world applications. I envision myself contributing to and leading projects that utilise big data to drive innovation, optimise processes, and improve decision-making. My ultimate career objective is to ascend to a leadership role within the technology and analytics sector, where I can shape industry standards and practices while mentoring the next generation of data scientists and analysts.
                            
                            This trajectory is not only a professional goal but also a personal commitment to excel in a field that combines my interests in technology, business, and problem-solving. By aligning with organisations that value innovation and data-driven decision making, I strive to make a meaningful impact on the business landscape and achieve excellence in my future endeavors. </p>                        <div class="features">

It starts with labeled observations, which are divided into a training set and a test set. The training set is used by a machine learning algorithm to create a prediction model. This model is then tested using the test set to evaluate its performance, with the results summarised in a statistical report. The process involves iterative improvement of the model based on its accuracy and the stats provided. .</li>

In supervised learning, each data point in the training set is labeled with the correct answer, and the model learns to predict these labels by determining a decision boundary. Once trained, it can apply this knowledge to new, unseen data. Unsupervised learning, in contrast, deals with unlabeled data. The model looks for patterns and structures within the data, such as clustering similar data points together. The resulting model can then assign new data points to these discovered clusters without prior knowledge of any labels.</li>

ML-centric startups, where machine learning is integral to the product, must focus on effective training, deployment, and maintenance of ML models. Non-ML startups, on the other hand, may delay extensive data operations until they achieve product-market fit, focusing on minimal viable data practices initially.</p>

                        <h1>More About Me</h1>
                        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                        <h3>I enjoy a variety of activities during my free time that keep me active, relaxed, and connected with friends. Playing for St. Vincent's GAA Club is a big part of my life. The games are exciting and the practices challenging, but more than that, they help me build strong friendships and learn important skills like working together and staying positive, whether we win or lose. <br>
                           <br>
                            <ul class="actions">
                            <li><a href="https://stvincentsgaa.ie/" class="button scrolly">My Club website </a></li>
                        </ul>

                            Swimming in the sea at places like High Rock in Malahide or Dollymount is another hobby I love. It's calming and invigorating to swim in the open water, and I feel refreshed and more connected to the natural world around me with every swim.
                            
                            I also go to Westwood Gym in Clontarf regularly. It's not just about working out; I really enjoy using the spa area to relax and help my muscles recover after exercise. This keeps me ready for my next workout or game day.
                            
                            Golf is another sport I take part in at Clontarf Golf Club. Playing golf teaches me patience and helps improve my focus as I try to make the perfect shot. It's also incredibly peaceful to play in the early morning when it's just me, the course, and the quiet.
                            
                            Socializing is an important part of my life too. Whether I'm catching up with friends over coffee in the morning or hanging out at local pubs, I cherish these times. These moments are fun and they strengthen the friendships that are important to me.
                            
                            All these activities are more than just hobbies. They keep me healthy, bring me happiness, and make my life fuller. Each one has its own special place in my week, helping me grow as a person and enjoy life to the fullest.<h3>
